title: All Quiet on the Western Front

The first book mentioned by Bob Dylan in his acceptance speech for his 2016 Nobel Prize
in literature as influencing his development as an artist and song-writer was 
Erich Maria Remarque's *All Quiet on the Western Front*

Of the three works of literature Dylan mentioned in his speech, *All Quiet on the Western Front* 
was the only one that I read multiple times.

## Pictorial influences
Besides my common perceptions and understanding of trench warfare comes from my first 
reading of *All Quiet on the Western Front* when I was an adolescent. The book was one 
of the few that my parents retained and I read it at least twice growing up.
