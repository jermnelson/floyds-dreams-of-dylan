title: Nobel Prize

With being awarded for his significant contributions to world literature through his songs 
and song-writing, Bob Dylan was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature. In the painting,
I'm modifying the representation with a side portrait of Floyd as the Alfred Nobel
that is on the actual medal.
