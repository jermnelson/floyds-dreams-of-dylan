title: Inside Bob Dylan's Head

As a fan and an artist, my appreciation for Bob Dylan's craft
and artisan approach to music developed and deepened because of 
 my friendship with my friend Floyd in Salt Lake City.  

 This is my attempt at a Bob Dylan portrait 
 based on the above photo of a young Bob Dylan taken by Daniel Kramer in 1965 New York.

 and a Day with Bob Dylan</a>)
 
My first version is clearly not a pure or even a good copy of the photo, 
especially as the lips make Dylan look a transvestite, which maybe isn't
something Dylan would totally reject, but definitely shows how amateur my 
painting style actual is compared to most trained artists. 

The second attempt I will use a technique of creating and printing the 
photograph and then transfer the grid to the painting.
Here is the grid attempt:
