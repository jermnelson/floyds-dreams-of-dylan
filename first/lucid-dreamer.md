title: Floyd's Lucid Dream

<img src="/static/img/floyd-shiery.png" style="float:right">

The central conceit of <em>Floyd's Dreams of Dylan</em> is we are given a glimpse of my friend Floyd's lucid dream, 
perhaps aided by herbal enhancements, as he imagines an island society infused with the music and presence of 
Bob Dylan.

In the lower right corner of <em>Floyd's Dreams of Dylan</em>, is a lighter area where the
outlines of a man's face with round glasses is smiling as he observes the scenes unfolding 
in front of him.
