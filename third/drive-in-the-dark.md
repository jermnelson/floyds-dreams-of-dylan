title: Floyds Dreams of Dylan #3 - Drive in the Dark

![Sketch One](floyds-dream-of-dylan-3-sketch.png)

### Background
I started sketching the second painting for the Floyd's Dreams of Dylan where I imagined driving
down a night rural road in a convertible. I want to share the podcast/pirate radio of the first
painting in the series so the conceit of this second painting is that the convertible's radio 
would be a copy of the first radio station of the first painting. 

## Fiberglass Frame with Buick

[This article](http://phscollectorcarworld.blogspot.com/2012/08/lost-star-cars-cars-and-bikes-of-bob.html) references a quote by Dylan that with this first large check, he purchased a 1966 Blue 
Mustang convertible, so I am going to model the dash in the painting on that year of Mustang.
