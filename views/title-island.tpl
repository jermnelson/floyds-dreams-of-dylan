<h1>Title Island</h1>
<h2>Floyd's Dreams of Dylan</h2>
<p>
 This part of the painting is a floating island forested with evergreen pine trees
 in a black sea of ink. The title of the painting, <em>Floyd's Dreams of Dylan</em> are 
 massive monuments to the tiny, ant-like people that inhabit and live on Title Island.`

 The <strong>o</strong> in Floyd, is a large Ferris wheel. The colorful designs are inspired by the
 late 1960's hippie aesthetics of the Beatles's <em>Yellow Subermarine</em>.
