<h1>Inside Bob Dylan's Head</h1>

 As a fan and an artist, my appreciation for Bob Dylan's craft
 and artisan approach to music developed and deepened because of 
 my friendship with my friend Floyd in Salt Lake City.  
</p>
<p>
 This is my attempt at a Bob Dylan portrait 
 based on the above photo of a young Bob Dylan taken by Daniel Kramer in 1965 New York.
 (See <a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2012/03/19/a-year-and-a-day-with-bob-dylan/#1">A Year 
 and a Day with Bob Dylan</a>)
</p>
<p>
 My version is clearly not a pure or even a good copy of the photo, 
 especially as the lips make Dylan look a transvestite, which maybe isn't
 something Dylan would totally reject, but definitely shows how amatuar my 
 painting style actual is compared to most trained artists.
